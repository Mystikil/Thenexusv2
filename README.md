### Project

* The Forgotten Server is a free and open-source MMORPG server emulator written in C++.
* It is a fork of the [The Forgotten Server 1.4.2](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver/releases/tag/v1.4.2) project.
* To connect to the server, you can use: [OTClient V8](https://github.com/OTAcademy/otclientv8), [OTClient Redemption](https://github.com/mehah/otclient) or Tibia Client 10.98.

* ATTENTION: This version consists of maintaining the protocol of the version TFS-1.4.2 but with all the code updates and bugs fixed by TFS-main.
