# üåç Nexus Living World System  
### Version 1.0 ‚Äî for The Forgotten Server 10.98 (C++17 / Lua 5.4)

---

## üß© Overview

The **Living World System** transforms the Nexus Server into a reactive, evolving world.

Every monster, every dungeon, and every floor dynamically changes in difficulty and reward
based on **player activity**, **floor depth**, and **instance tier**.  
The more players farm an area, the more dangerous (and profitable) it becomes.

No client mods. No visuals. Pure, text-driven mechanics.

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Player Features

- **Monsters evolve.**  
  Every creature in the world has a **Rank Tier** (F ‚Üí SSSSSS) that defines its power.

- **World fights back.**  
  Each floor and region remembers how active it‚Äôs been. Kill too many monsters in an area and the ecosystem grows stronger.

- **Persistent ecosystem.**  
  The world saves its ‚Äúpressure‚Äù between restarts and slowly cools down when ignored.

- **Depth & instance scaling.**  
  Deeper floors and higher-tier instances spawn stronger, rarer monsters.

- **Rewards scale with danger.**  
  Higher ranks drop better loot, yield more XP, and may even roll extra loot tables.

## üß† Rank Tiers (F ‚Üí SSSSSS)

| Rank | Category | Description | Behavior |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| F‚ÄìC | Common | Weak creatures, surface wildlife | Low XP and loot |
| B‚ÄìA | Elite | Trained enemies, mini-bosses | +HP, +damage, richer loot |
| S‚ÄìSSS | Champion | Apex monsters, rare spawns | High difficulty, high reward |
| SSSS‚ÄìSSSSSS | Legendary | Dungeon bosses, world anomalies | Massive HP, top-tier loot |

Each rank tier modifies:
- Health  
- Damage output  
- Damage mitigation  
- XP reward  
- Loot multiplier  
- Extra loot rolls  
- Resistances  
- Speed  
- AI cooldowns  
- Spell access level

---

## üèóÔ∏è Core Systems

### 1. Monster Rank System (C++ / JSON)

- Assigns a rank on spawn from config values.
- Scales all monster stats accordingly.
- Configurable via `data/monster_ranks.json` ‚Äî no rebuild needed.
- Safe to toggle (`"enabled": true/false`).

---

### 2. Rank Assignment Logic

Each spawn‚Äôs rank is determined by **three factors:**

| Factor | Source | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Floor (Z)** | Higher/lower elevation = higher rank | Floor 8+ ‚Üí +1 rank |
| **Instance Tier** | Harder dungeons = higher rank | Tier ‚â• 5 ‚Üí +3 ranks |
| **World Pressure** | Player activity drives difficulty | Frequent kills = +1 rank bias |

Final Rank = BaseRank + FloorOffset + InstanceOffset + PressureOffset

---

### 3. World Pressure Manager

A global background system that tracks **player activity intensity**.

| Function | Behavior |
|-----------|-----------|
| **registerKill** | Adds intensity based on monster rank |
| **decayAll** | Reduces intensity over time |
| **getPressureBias** | Feeds difficulty bias into spawn ranks |
| **saveJson / loadJson** | Saves and restores world state |

Each region of the map has its own pressure level that:
- Increases with kills  
- Decays over time  
- Raises spawn rank probability while high  
- Persists across restarts (`data/rank_pressure.json`)

---

### 4. Combat & Loot Hooks

- Outgoing monster damage √ó rank multiplier  
- Incoming damage reduced by mitigation & resist  
- XP scaled by rank XP multiplier  
- Loot rolls scaled by rank loot multiplier  
- Extra loot rolls per rank (`extraRolls`)

Fully integrated; no Lua changes required.

---

### 5. Staff Visibility

- GMs (group ‚â• 3) see monster rank in the look description:

Rank: SSS

yaml
Copy code

- Players do not see this by default (future reveal item planned).

---

### 6. Persistence & Decay

- All pressure data saved in `data/rank_pressure.json`.
- Automatic decay keeps difficulty self-balancing.
- Configurable via JSON key `pressureDecayPerMinute`.

---

## üßÆ System Architecture

| Module | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| **RankSystem** | Handles rank tiers, JSON parsing, scaling |
| **WorldPressureManager** | Tracks kill pressure, decay, persistence |
| **Monster Hooks** | Applies rank at spawn, adjusts stats |
| **Combat Hooks** | Scales incoming/outgoing damage |
| **Death Hooks** | Applies XP/loot scaling, updates pressure |
| **Game::onLook** | Adds rank line for staff visibility |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Config Path
data/monster_ranks.json

bash
Copy code

### Rank Scalars
| Key | Function |
|-----|-----------|
| hp | Max HP multiplier |
| dmg | Outgoing damage multiplier |
| mit | Incoming damage reduction (0‚Äì0.8) |
| xp | XP multiplier |
| lootMult | Loot multiplier |
| extraRolls | Extra loot rolls |
| speedDelta | Speed adjustment |
| resist | Flat % damage reduction |
| aiCdMult | AI cooldown multiplier |
| spellUnlock | Unlocks advanced boss spells |

### Performance
- **O(1)** per spawn and kill.  
- Decay touches only recently modified regions.  
- No measurable impact on server tick.

---

## üß± Persistence

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `data/monster_ranks.json` | Rank definitions, weights, and rules |
| `data/rank_pressure.json` | Runtime world memory of pressure levels |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Category | Features |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Dynamic Ranks** | 12-tier ladder (F‚ÄìSSSSSS) |
| **Scaling Logic** | Floor + Instance + Pressure offsets |
| **World Memory** | Pressure tracking per region |
| **Combat Hooks** | Rank-based damage scaling |
| **XP & Loot** | Rank-based XP and loot |
| **Persistence** | JSON saved, auto decay |
| **Performance Safe** | Constant-time operations |
| **Extensible** | Ready for events & economy tie-ins |
| **Zero Client Mods** | All text-based |

---

## üîç How It Works (Developer Breakdown)

1. **Spawn**
   - When a monster is created:
     1. Base rank picked from weighted table.
     2. Offsets applied from floor/instance/pressure rules.
     3. Final rank applied to HP, speed, and cached multipliers.

2. **Combat**
   - Monster attacks: damage scaled by `dmg`.
   - Monster defends: incoming reduced by `mit` and `resist`.

3. **Death**
   - XP and loot scaled.
   - Pressure updated for the region.

4. **Decay**
   - Background decay every minute reduces pressure intensity.

5. **Save / Load**
   - On shutdown: `rank_pressure.json` saved.
   - On startup: world restored exactly as it was.

---

## üß≠ Admin Tools (Optional Lua)

- `/rankpressure here` ‚Üí show region intensity  
- `/rankpressure reset` ‚Üí reset region pressure  
- `/rankdebug` ‚Üí print floor / instance / pressure offsets  

---

## üóìÔ∏è Expansion Hooks (Phase 2 Ready)

- **Outbreak Events:** automatic boss spawns on over-pressured zones  
- **Ecosystem Drift:** species migration based on rank trends  
- **Seasonal Modifiers:** world-wide buffs/nerfs by real month  
- **Economy Integration:** rare resource yields increase with pressure  
- **World Log:** persistent record of outbreaks and cleanses  

All can be implemented with Lua + existing engine hooks.
